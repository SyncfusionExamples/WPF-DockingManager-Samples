# How to bind custom commands to built-in context menu items of document tabitem in WPF DockingManager?

[WPF DockingManager](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/docking) has individual routed event to notify the TabItem closing by below context menu items of DocumentTabItem,
1)	Close 
2)	CloseAll
3)	CloseAllButThis

Using commands to notify those actions is recommended if the application has MVVM structure. DockingManager has built-in support to bind the custom commands for those ContextMenu actions.
